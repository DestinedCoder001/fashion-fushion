## Description

This is a fashion website where you can find your favourite clothing. You can search for clothing, add them to cart, add to favourites so you can come back to them later and checkout payment. Designed from a Figma file and also some design inspiration from [asos.com](https://asos.com). I also used an asos API on [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com).
